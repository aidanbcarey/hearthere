<p>Welcome! On this website you will see four pages (with the exception of this one).</p>
<p> The first is the on login page, which urges you to connect your Spotify account.</p>
<p> Next, we have the querying page. This tells the workers to fetch the lyrics of your top n songs on Spotify (n specified by you - so interactive!)</p>
<p> Finally, the data pages! These compare the frequencies of words in the songs you listen to to those found in a reference dataset (all Billboard top songs of the 2010s).</p>
